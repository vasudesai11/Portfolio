# Hey, I'm Vasu 👋

🚀 Engineer | Strategist | Problem-Solver  

I’m a **B.Tech Computer Science student** at Symbiosis Institute of Technology (2022–26) — blending an engineer’s mindset with a strategist’s lens.  

I love turning vague ideas into structured outcomes:  
- From **messy slides** to **tangled data**, I bring clarity where most bring templates.  
- I care about systems that make sense — whether it’s **code, business logic, or big decisions**.  
- Clear thinking > loud opinions.  

## 🌟 What I Do
- Build projects around **data, strategy, and problem-solving**.  
- Work on **business intelligence, analytics, and AI/ML**.  
- Lead teams in **finance, events, and strategy roles** at university clubs.  

## 🏆 A Few Highlights
- 💡 Created analytics dashboards that unlocked insights from 5+ years of sales data.  
- 📊 Built machine learning models to predict churn & optimize pricing.  
- 🌱 Finance Lead @ V@rSITy Club (managing ₹3.2L budget).  
- 🎤 Events Lead @ ACM Club (100+ attendees per workshop).  

## 🎮 Beyond Work
When I’m not untangling data or strategy problems, you’ll find me:  
- Playing **competitive strategy games** (thinking 5 moves ahead never stops).  
- Exploring **space, animals, and tech that shapes the future**.
